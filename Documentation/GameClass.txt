Game Class:

Constructor and Deconstructor
    The constructor creates two heap allocated player objects (Player 1 and player 2) and sets totalXs to zero.
    The deconstructor deletes the player objects.

void play()
    In main.cpp, a game object is created and calls the play function. 
    The play function is responible for running the battleship. The players first 
    setup their boards (calling on setup()) and then enters a while loop that goes through
    a player's turn. This will continue until all ships are sunk and then prints out the current
    player as the winner of the game. The screen will clear off after each turn assuming the game isn't over.
    After setup, the total number of sunk spots are calculated to be used for the gameover function
    that acts as the checker. 

void turn(int currentPlayer)
    It will print out whose turn it is, and then it will pass over control to takeTurn function.

void takeTurn(Player *currentPlayer, Player *otherPlayer)
    The takeTurn function actually goes through a player's turn. First, it will show the player's boards and ship health.
    Then asks them for an attack location and will continue to do so until a valid coordinate is given.
    The attack will then occur, marking the boards. The player view is reprinted with the updated attack, and the turn is over. 

void clear()
    It will confirm that the player is done with their turn. Afterwards, it will clear the screen. 
    It then asks if the next player is ready for their turn. 

bool gameover()
    Based on the current player, it will go through their public board(their view of their opponent's board)
    and count the number of Xs which represent the sunk boats. If that number equals the same as the totalXs, 
    it will return true ending the game. Otherwise, the game keeps going.
    
bool validAttack(Player *attackingPlayer, int row, int col)
    The function takes in an attack coordinate from turn that is within the grid.
    The function using the player's public board (their view of their opponent's board) will see 
    if that location is water or *. If that is the case, the attack is valid and returns turn. 
    If they have already fired at that location (M,H, or X), then it will return false, and the player
    will have to enter a new coordinate.
